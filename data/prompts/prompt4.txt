I have a CAD render with GD&T data. I will provide a single element ID and want the respective GD&T data transcribed. Return the full GD&T data between <answer> tags. The most difficult part is selecting the correct GD&T symbol so be precise there. Here are the valid symbols
```
    gd_t_name_mapping = {
        "⏤": ["Straightness"],
        "⏥": ["Flatness"],
        "○": ["Circularity"],
        "⌭": ["Cylindricity"],
        "⌒": ["Profile of a Line", "Profile"],
        "⌓": ["Profile of a Surface", "Profile Surface"],
        "⟂": ["Perpendicularity"],
        "∠": ["Angularity"],
        "∥": ["Parallelism"], # though the symbol may look different
        "⌯": ["Symmetry"],
        "⌖": ["Position"],
        "◎": ["Concentricity"],
        "↗": ["Circular Runout"],
        "⌰": ["Total Runout"],
        "⌀": ["Diameter"],
        "⌢": ["Arc"],
        "◯": ["Roundness"],
        "": ["Custom GD&T Symbol 1"],
        "": ["Custom GD&T Symbol 2"],
        "±": ["Plus or Minus"],
        "…": [".*"],
        "↔": ["Connecting To"],
        "↧": ["Depth"],
        "⌲": ["Conical Taper"],
        "⌳": ["Slope"],
        "⌴": ["Counterbore"],
        "⌵": ["Countersink"],
        "□": ["Square"],
    }
    modifiers_name_mapping = {
        "→": ["Directional Indicator"],
        "⊕": ["Additive Tolerance"],
        "⊖": ["Subtractive Tolerance"],
        "⌂": ["Composite Tolerance"],
        "Ⓔ": ["Envelope Requirement"],
        "Ⓡ": ["Reference Feature"],
        "△": [
            "Datum Target",
            "Datum Feature",
            "Datum Feature Symbol",
        ],
        "◊": ["Basic Dimension"],
        "○": ["All Around"],
        "": ["Custom Modifier 1"],
        "Ⓕ": ["Free State"],
        "Ⓛ": ["Least Material Condition"],
        "Ⓜ": ["Maximum Material Condition"],
        "Ⓟ": ["Projected Tolerance Zone"],
        "Ⓢ": ["Regardless of Feature Size"],
        "Ⓣ": ["Tangent Plane"],
        "Ⓤ": ["Unequal Bilateral"],
    }
```

The rules for generating the labels are:
    Feature Control Frames (Rectangles)
    If a feature control frame (FCF) has multiple compartments (boxes), transcribe the first compartment (the primary GD&T symbol) in English (e.g., “Position,” “Flatness,” “Profile,” etc.).
    Subsequent compartments (tolerance value, modifiers, datum references) should be separated by the pipe character |.
    Example:
    A rectangle around “⌖|⌀.095Ⓔ|X|Y” → "Position ⌀.095Ⓔ|X|Y"
    A rectangle around “⏥ .03Ⓕ” → "Flatness .03Ⓕ"


    All Around Symbol
    A small circular arrow hooking outside the FCF indicates “All Around.”
    If present, append \nAll Around to that element’s transcription.
    Example:
    A rectangle with “⌒|.04|D|E-F” plus a small circular arrow → "Profile .04|D|E-F\nAll Around"


    Datum Feature Symbols
    If you see a standalone square/rectangle with a letter (e.g., “A”) and connected by line to Datum Target symbol "△" , transcribe it as "Datum Feature A" (or B, C, etc.).
    If your system uses an internal ID like “DF1,” map it: DF1 → "Datum Feature A".


    Elements with No Direct Text
       RLE: “Represented line element”
       LDN: “Leader-Directed Note <name>” (e.g., Leader-Directed Note L1)
       CH: “Crosshatch between <line1> and <line2>
    You will have to specify which lines or notes are involved (e.g., “Crosshatch between L1 and L2”).


    Multiple Boxes with One Symbol
    Sometimes a single GD&T symbol applies to two boxed and stacked compartments. If so, the symbol is on the first line, and the second line has the next compartments.
    Example:
    If you have “(profile symbol)” in the first box, and two stacked compartments .040|D|B|C over .005|D|B|C, transcribe:
    "Profile .040|D|B|C
    Profile .005|D|B|C"
    If there’s an “all around” arrow, append \nAll Around at the end of both.
    There may just be 2 seperate IDs on top of each other in which case this rule does not apply. Only when there's a single larger boxed symbol in front of 2 rectangles will they correspond to the same element ID.


    Stacked Dimensions at End of Line
    If the tolerance at the end of a a dimension has a top number over a bottom number taking up more height then the original row, transcribe it with a slash.
    Example:
    “5X ⌀.333” with “+.008” over “-.002” → "5X ⌀.333 +.008/-.002"
    Note there will often be multiple seperate element IDs stack on top of each other. They should be kept seperate.


    Default for Untoleranced Surfaces
    If there’s a rectangle or note that states “APPLIES TO ALL UNTOLERANCED SURFACES,” transcribe only the FCF plus that phrase.
    Example:
    “⌓ .07|X|Y|Z” and “APPLIES TO ALL UNTOLERANCED SURFACES” → "Profile Surface .07|X|Y|Z"


    No Need to Transcribe
    Coordinate Systems labeled “CSX”
    Plane or View Selection Indicators labeled “VSIX”
    Notes for the whole diagram, generally on the left side of the first page


Remember to take your time, go slow over the whole image till you find the element id, then transcribe the GD&T data, then apply the rules for the final return. Place the return within <answer> tags. Note that some text is slightly rotated, so mentally correct for that. Selecting the correct GD&T symbol is the hardest part, make sure it is exactly what's on the page.
