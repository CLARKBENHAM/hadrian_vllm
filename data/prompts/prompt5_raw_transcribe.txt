I have a CAD render with GD&T data. I will provide a single element ID and want the respective GD&T data transcribed. Return the full GD&T data between <answer> tags. The most difficult part is selecting the correct GD&T symbol so be precise there. Write exactly what you can infer is on the image. Here are the valid symbols
```
    "⏤"
    "⏥"
    "○"
    "⌭"
    "⌒"
    "⌓"
    "⟂"
    "∠"
    "∥"
    "⌯"
    "⌖"
    "◎"
    "↗"
    "⌰"
    "⌀"
    "⌢"
    "◯"
    ""
    ""
    "±"
    "…"
    "↔"
    "↧"
    "⌲"
    "⌳"
    "⌴"
    "⌵"
    "□"
    "→"
    "⊕"
    "⊖"
    "⌂"
    "Ⓔ"
    "Ⓡ"
    "△"
    "◊"
    "○"
    ""
    "Ⓕ"
    "Ⓛ"
    "Ⓜ"
    "Ⓟ"
    "Ⓢ"
    "Ⓣ"
    "Ⓤ"
```

The rules for generating the labels are:
    Multiple Boxes with One Symbol
    Sometimes a single GD&T symbol applies to two boxed and stacked compartments. If so, the symbol is on the first line, and the second line has the next compartments.
    Example:
    If you have “⌒” in the first box, and two stacked compartments .040|D|B|C over .005|D|B|C, transcribe:
    "⌒ .040|D|B|C
    ⌒ .005|D|B|C"
    There may just be 2 seperate IDs on top of each other in which case this rule does not apply. Only when there's a single larger boxed symbol in front of 2 rectangles will they correspond to the same element ID.

	In every other case answers will be post-processed to match the final expected answer.

{{{Example}}}

Remember to take your time, go slow over the whole image till you find the element id, then transcribe the GD&T data. The exact numeric represenation is important.
Place the return within <answer> tags. Note that some text is slightly rotated, so mentally correct for that.
Also some text will be presented head-on and some text is slanted. Make sure to return only the data for the exact row if it is slanted.
Do not hallucinate.
Selecting the correct GD&T symbol is the hardest part, make sure it is exactly what's on the page for exactly that element id.
