Using a vLLM to solve Hadrian's Conversions Issues
Take CAD Model of ideal shape, Blueprint with tolerances, return unified standard.

# Standards
semantic PMI for machine, graphic PMI for humans


# Data Sources
NIST - 12 labeled assembly and part examples
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tdtUZaJAdkri25PN4LroGV-EJTjW0Uh98TclfjHdJlk/edit?gid=462465708#gid=462465708 where it's all munged together, use "data/fsi_labels/Hadrian\ Vllm\ test\ case\ -\ Final\ Merge.csv" and fsi labeled parts
More advanced AP242 case http://www.asd-ssg.org/step-ap242-benchmark.html

Can't use STEP file analyzer and view since on mac

Synthetic Data:
	get CAD model, create 2d plans from render, add a bunch of notation see if can map back to part?
		How to annotate each part on blueprint via cad?

# Which vLLM
Try Azure for 4o

Itar complient:
	Try Sonnet 3.5, 4o.
	Don't go to self-hosting yet.
Without ITAR it'd be:
	google gemini-2.0 (only via api not console unless advanced user)

ITAR compliant:
	aws has GovCloud and any US-WEST  `AWS GovCloud (US-West)` qualifies
		sonnet 3.5, Haiku 3.5, Llama 3 70B Instruct,
		https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-bedrock.html
		Can finetune haiku 3.5; not sonnet. Unclear if allowed while ITAR compliant
	Azure Gov
		can use 4o via "FedRAMP High Authorization for Azure Government"  https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-openai-fedramp-high-for-government/?utm_source=chatgpt.com
			unclear if can finetune
		but none of o-class model yet https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/azure-government
	Google "Assured Workflows"
		ITAR services https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/itar-restrictions-limitations
			doesn't seem to include an models?
		Requires an org to start using: https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/compliance/assuredworkloads?hl=en&pli=1&supportedpurview=organizationId&orgonly=true
